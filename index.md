### Hi, I'm Filippos Sofias ðŸ‘‹
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Professor Brendan Saltaformaggio.
My research interests lie at the intersection of program analysis, reverse engineering, memory and cyber forensics, and machine learning.

Outside of research, I enjoy gaming with friends, cooking, and fencing. When I get the chance, I love to head to the mountains for some skiing and a change of pace.
